/**
 * Demonstrates how clicks and key inputs are watched, converted into effects that our game engine
 * can interpret, and pass throughout the engine as necessary
 * 
 * It is the job of this screen interaction class to watch and change these clicks and key inputs it
 * IGlobalEffects. Then this class simple queues these effects. Every time the game loop in a given
 * game occurs there is a step that dequeues these effects and
 * passes them to the current level to process. The effects are queued and retrieved all at once for
 * two reasons. First, it gives us great flexibility when these effects are processed. Second, it
 * avoids concurrency errors. It is quite possible that if these effects propagated immediately they
 * could influence the game mid-update in an undesirable way (i.e cause an effect that will cause a
 * Sprite to add to a list that is currently being looped over).
 * 
 * The Interaction interpreter is given a pane on which it watches. This is the main pane where the
 * game screen is rendered.
 * This is instantiated once for the game and passed by reference to this class.
